# Claude Kickstart

Claude Code becomes much more useful once it understands who you are, what you care about, and how you like to work.

Claude Kickstart gives new users a guided first experience. You speak or type naturally, it learns enough about your world to generate useful possibilities, and then it helps you make or explore something real.

**You do not need to know how to code.** You can ramble, use dictation, make typos, change your mind, or reject every suggestion.

## Start here

You need [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) and Node.js 18 or newer.

Open Claude Code in an empty folder and paste this sentence:

> Install Claude Kickstart from https://github.com/hermes-labs-ai/claude-kickstart and walk me through it — I'm new to this.

That is enough. The repository carries its own instructions for the installing agent
(`AGENTS.md`): it will briefly explain what Kickstart is before downloading anything, keep
everything inside your folder, run the installer, and hand you **one copy-paste line** that
starts Kickstart. On a Mac the installer even puts that line on your clipboard for you.

The line looks like this (with your real folder path):

```text
cd -- /path/to/your/folder && claude "/kickstart"
```

Paste it into your terminal (type `/exit` first if you're still inside Claude Code) and
Kickstart begins. The same line works any time you come back — nothing to memorize. If a
workspace trust screen appears, confirm it names your folder, review the project
permissions, and choose **Yes, I trust this folder**. The one close-and-reopen is how Claude
Code discovers newly installed project commands — part of installation, not an error.

## What your first session feels like

Claude Kickstart will:

1. ask how carefully it should handle actions in the folder;
2. invite you to describe yourself in your own words;
3. ask two or three follow-up questions based on what you actually said;
4. show what it heard as facts and what it is only tentatively inferring;
5. offer several specific things you could make, explore, understand, or improve;
6. let you choose, combine, change, or reject those ideas; and
7. begin one real thing with you immediately.

The choices appear in Claude Code's built-in selector when it is available. A free-text path is always available, so the menu never limits what you can ask for.

After that, ordinary language is the interface. Try things like:

> Make the second idea more playful.

> None of those. Surprise me in a different direction.

> I feel overwhelmed. Give me one tiny next step.

> Explain what you just changed.

## Stop, resume, or correct it

Leave guided mode without deleting anything:

```text
/leave-kickstart
```

You can also say “turn this off” or “go back to normal Claude.” Starting a fresh Claude Code session gives you the cleanest normal context.

If onboarding is interrupted, run `/kickstart` again. It resumes from the saved stage.

Your portrait is plain Markdown in `claude-kickstart/state/user-portrait.md`. At any time, say:

- “Show me what you think you know about me.”
- “That is wrong—update my portrait.”
- “Delete my portrait.”
- “Use simpler guidance.”
- “Let me take more control.”

Deletion and reset require confirmation. Both delete the private extracted-history corpus;
reset preserves everything in `claude-kickstart/creations/`.

## Safety and privacy

Claude Kickstart stays inside this project by default. It does not change your global Claude settings, inspect unrelated personal files, read common credential files, bypass permissions, or publish anything for you. Consequential actions still require an explanation and your approval.

Your portrait, interview notes, progress state, and creations remain local files in the project. The optional existing-history fast lane reads only eligible local Claude Code transcripts and memory after an engine-recorded choice; choosing the interview mechanically blocks extraction. Its private corpus stays in the project and is deleted with either “Delete my portrait” or reset. These state files are ignored by Git so they are not accidentally committed. You can read, edit, or delete them.

This is defense in depth, not an operating-system sandbox. Always read Claude Code's permission prompts before approving them.

## Manual installation

### Python installer preview

This draft branch adds a project-local Python installer. It is not published on PyPI yet. Once this pull request is reviewed and merged, the GitHub form can be tested with:

```sh
pip install "git+https://github.com/hermes-labs-ai/claude-kickstart.git"
claude-kickstart install
```

The equivalent module command is `python -m claude_kickstart install`. PyPI installation will be documented only after an authenticated publication is completed and independently verified.

If you already downloaded the repository, open a terminal inside it and run:

macOS or Linux:

```sh
bash install.sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\install.ps1
```

Installation is project-local and repeatable. It initializes only missing state and never overwrites your portrait, history, or creations.

To stop using it, run `/leave-kickstart`. Because the installation is self-contained, you can then archive or remove the repository whenever you no longer need the local portrait or creations. Nothing global needs uninstalling.

## If something does not work

- **`/kickstart` is not recognized:** type `/exit`; run the exact `cd` command printed by the installer; run `claude`; and try `/kickstart` again. If it still fails, tell Claude: “Verify `.claude/commands/kickstart.md` in this folder and repair only this project-local installation.”
- **Claude says a required file is missing:** make sure you opened the downloaded `claude-kickstart` folder, then run the installer again. It will explain what is missing without guessing or overwriting files.
- **Node.js is missing or too old:** install Node.js 18 or newer, confirm `node --version` works, and rerun the installer.
- **You see a workspace trust screen:** confirm the folder came from `hermes-labs-ai/claude-kickstart`, review the listed project permissions, and proceed only if you trust it.
- **You stopped halfway through:** reopen the same folder and run `/kickstart`; your pending stage should resume.

If the problem remains, open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/hermes-labs-ai/claude-kickstart/issues) without including private portrait or session content.

## Requirements and honest limits

- Claude Code 2.1 or newer
- Node.js 18 or newer
- Tested on macOS with the current Claude Code CLI
- One close-and-reopen is required after the first installation so Claude Code can discover Kickstart's project command, safety settings, and lifecycle hooks
- Shell installer exercised on macOS; the PowerShell installer is syntax- and logic-checked but has not been run on Windows in this release
- Claude generates the adaptive questions and possibilities at runtime, so exact wording varies
- If Claude Code's native selector is unavailable, Kickstart uses a numbered text fallback
- The thin project-command files use Claude Code's legacy custom-command surface; Anthropic may eventually require a compatibility update

## How it works

Claude Kickstart is a small stateful harness, not a personality quiz or a single sequential prompt. A project command loads its runtime contract; a local state engine records onboarding checkpoints, safe exit, portrait ownership, and evidence-based changes in guidance. Synthetic fixtures verify that different people receive materially different possibilities.

See [DEMO.md](DEMO.md) for a ten-minute friend demo and [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for architecture and test commands.

## About

Claude Kickstart is built by [Hermes Labs](https://hermes-labs.ai) — a research practice in
**Epistemic Engineering**: engineering AI reliability at the language operations layer, not at the model substrate. The position:
**the model is the substrate**, but **language is the operations layer** — where deployed
reliability is won or lost. Kickstart is the newcomer-facing end of that work: **linguistic
infrastructure** that lets a person who has never touched a terminal direct an AI agent
safely, in their own words.
