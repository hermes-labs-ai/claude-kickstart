# Adaptive Onboarding

Follow the saved stage. Never ask the entire interview at once.

## `awaiting_safety`

Use `AskUserQuestion` with header `Safety`, single-select, and these options in this order:

1. **Safest default** — Keep work inside this folder and ask before actions.
2. **Files here okay** — Create harmless files here, but ask before anything broader.
3. **Ask every time** — Explain and ask before even harmless project-file changes.

The safest choice is recommended. Save the answer with:

```text
node claude-kickstart/bin/kickstart-state.mjs checkpoint awaiting_self_description
```

Then ask the open prompt below in the same response only after the safety selection is known.

## `awaiting_self_description`

A single wide-open "tell me about yourself" overwhelms many first users — they don't know
what you need or why you're asking. So this stage has three parts, all within this one
checkpointed stage.

**Part 1 — say why, in one or two sentences, before asking anything.** In your own words:

> Quick note on why I ask anything at all: I fit ideas to you from both *what* you tell me and *how* you tell it. Everything you share stays in a plain file in this folder that you can read, correct, or delete anytime. More material means better-fitted ideas — but you choose how much to share, and you can skip anything.

**Part 2 — structured starters.** One `AskUserQuestion` call with these four questions
(same for every user; free-text `Other` is automatic on each):

1. header `Your days` — "What does most of your time go to right now?" — options: Working / Studying / Raising a family or caring for someone / Retired or between things. Single-select.
2. header `Draws you` — "What kinds of things pull at you? Pick any." — options: Making something real / Understanding something deeply / Organizing chaos / Helping someone specific. **multiSelect: true.**
3. header `Computers` — "How do you feel about computers?" — options: Honestly pretty new to this / I get by / Comfortable / This part is easy for me. Single-select.
4. header `First win` — "What would feel best first?" — options: A small finished thing today / The first step of something bigger / Just understanding what's possible. Single-select.

**Part 3 — the open door, now smaller and explained.** After their selections:

> Now the part only you can type: tell me a little about yourself in your own words — what you're into, what frustrates you, what you wish existed. Ramble freely; dictation mistakes and half-thoughts are fine. Even two sentences is plenty — the questions I ask next will do the rest.

Before asking each part, checkpoint this stage and write the exact pending prompt to `onboarding-notes.md`. Record the structured selections AND the free text in the notes. Then generate two or three follow-ups that depend on what the user actually said.

**Richness guard:** the structured answers are scaffolding, not categories — never let them
narrow the portrait or the possibilities. The free text and generated follow-ups remain the
primary material; a user whose selections say "Retired / Organizing chaos" but whose words
are all about story-writing gets story-writing possibilities. If the free text is rich, the
selections merely confirm register; if the free text is thin, the selections carry more
weight and your follow-ups should reopen the door the open question couldn't.

## `awaiting_followup_1` through `awaiting_followup_3`

Ask one generated follow-up at a time. Two are required; a third is optional only when a material gap remains.

Bad: “Do you prefer writing or coding?”

Good: “You said family recipes get lost because everyone improvises. Would preserving the stories, making weeknights easier, or learning the substitutions your family actually likes matter most?”

Checkpoint the next pending follow-up before asking it. Record the question and later the answer in the notes.

## `awaiting_portrait_confirmation`

Synthesize `state/user-portrait.md` with these sections:

- Explicitly shared
- Interests and recurring themes
- Desired outcomes and frictions
- Learning and communication preferences
- Explicit boundaries
- Provisional interaction hypotheses

Then reflect in the terminal under two unmistakable headings: **What you told me** and **What I am tentatively inferring**. Ask the user to correct, remove, or add anything. Do not proceed until they have had the chance to correct it. Record corrections as progression evidence.

## `awaiting_orientation`

Ask one nonclinical, indirect orientation question. Generate its wording from the portrait when possible. A fallback is:

> Imagine one recurring friction in your week quietly disappeared. What changed?

You may instead use a native single-select with four fitted outcomes such as making something real, understanding something deeply, helping someone, organizing chaos, or discovering something unexpected. The automatic free-text path remains available. Do not call this a personality test.

## `awaiting_possibility`

Read `METHOD.md`. Generate four concrete paths:

- three distinctly personalized directions spanning practical/exploratory, software/non-software, and immediate/ambitious;
- one personalized **Surprise me** that combines two themes the user did not combine themselves.

Before the selector, explain each in 2–3 short lines: why it fits, what the user would do, and what could exist in 10–30 minutes. Then use native multi-select with those four options. The automatic `Other` path is the free response. Explicitly say the user may choose, combine, modify, reject, or answer in their own words.

When the user settles on a direction, write the plain-language choice or combination to `state/pending-selection.md` with the Edit tool, run `select-from-pending`, checkpoint `first_action`, and say:

> Great. We will start small enough that you can see the result, but real enough that it matters.

Then run `complete` and begin the tangible action in the same response. Do not end with a tutorial or command list.
