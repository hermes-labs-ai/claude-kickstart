# Existing-History Fast Lane

For people who already have real Claude Code history on this machine. Instead of the
interview, the portrait is derived from what they have actually typed — then confirmed
with them exactly as an interviewed portrait would be. `ONBOARDING.md` remains the
authoritative flow for every stage not described here.

## When to offer it

After the safety choice is saved and before the self-description interview begins, run:

```text
node claude-kickstart/bin/kickstart-state.mjs history-scan
```

It reads nothing into the conversation and writes nothing; it returns counts and an
`eligible` verdict (at least 5 interactive sessions and 100 usable typed messages —
sessions with fewer than 3 typed messages are automated noise and never count). If not
eligible, say nothing about the fast lane and continue at `awaiting_self_description`;
a thin corpus makes a thin portrait, and the interview is strictly better.

## `awaiting_history_choice`

If eligible, checkpoint this stage, then offer the choice with one `AskUserQuestion`
call, header `Fast lane`, single-select:

1. **Use my history** — Build my portrait from what I've already typed here (it stays on this machine; I review and correct it before anything happens).
2. **Interview me instead** — Ask me the normal questions; ignore my history.

Before the question, say plainly in one or two sentences: this reads their own past
Claude Code messages and local memory notes, entirely on this machine, and nothing is
kept without their review. If they choose the interview, never read history and continue
at `awaiting_self_description`. If they choose their history, run:

```text
node claude-kickstart/bin/kickstart-state.mjs history-extract
```

## Synthesizing the derived portrait

Read `claude-kickstart/state/pro-corpus.json` and write `state/user-portrait.md` with
the same six sections as the interviewed portrait. Non-negotiable rules:

- **Two tiers, always.** A fact is something the user literally typed, and it carries a
  terse provenance tag (project or session). Everything else is a tentative inference,
  labeled as such. Memory chunks are secondhand (assistant-authored) — they may support
  an inference but can never make something a fact.
- **Provenance firewall.** Only content inside `pro-corpus.json` may become a fact. If
  you recognize something about the user from anywhere else — project instructions,
  memory outside the corpus, this conversation — it does not enter the portrait as fact.
- **Quote verbatim.** When quoting the user, quote exactly, typos included. If you must
  normalize a quote for readability, mark it as lightly edited. Never silently clean up.
- **Exclude simulated voices.** Transcripts can contain synthetic personas, pasted text,
  role-play, and test sessions. When first-person statements are inconsistent with the
  rest of the corpus or come from obvious test contexts, leave them out rather than
  attribute them.
- **No scoring.** No personality typing, no numeric trait dimensions, no vulnerability
  or persuasion analysis. Same rule as everywhere in this harness.
- **Honest thinness.** If a section has no real support in the corpus, say so in the
  portrait instead of padding it.

After writing the portrait, run the mechanical check — the rules above are enforced,
not trusted:

```text
node claude-kickstart/bin/kickstart-state.mjs portrait-verify
```

It checks every quoted span in the portrait against the extracted corpus and fails if
any quote is not verbatim corpus text. Fix each reported quote — restore the exact
original, remove it, or mark its line `(lightly edited)` — and re-run until it passes.
Never show the user an unverified portrait.

Then checkpoint `awaiting_portrait_confirmation` and follow `ONBOARDING.md` from there,
with one adaptation: a derived portrait is bigger than an interviewed one, so walk the
confirmation section by section — facts first, then inferences — and invite corrections
per section rather than in one pass. Record corrections as `corrected_assumption`
evidence. The user's corrections outrank the corpus.

## After confirmation

Someone with real history usually needs less hand-holding. After the portrait is
confirmed, ask one native single-select (header `Pace`): keep the guided pace, or start
further along. If they choose the latter, run `level 3 --confirm` (their explicit choice
is the confirmation) and skip the orientation question — go directly to possibilities,
which should lean on the frictions and active projects the corpus actually shows.
The safety stage is never skipped in either lane: it is consent, not skill.
